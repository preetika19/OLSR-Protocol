# OLSR-Protocol
An implementation of Optimized Link State Routing Protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.

Protocol includes three types of messages:
1. HELLO - These messages are the hello messages exchanged between neighbor nodes
2. TC - These are the topology control messages that are flooded throughout the network
3. DATA - These are data messages that are sent from a source to a destination
